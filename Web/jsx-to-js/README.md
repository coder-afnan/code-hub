# JSX to JS Transpiler

This is a simple tool that converts JSX code to plain JavaScript code. JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML. JSX closely resembles HTML-like syntax, which allows developers to dynamically create UI components. JSX is commonly used in React to create and render UI components in a webpage.

Browsers do not directly understand JSX code. Instead, it is transformed  into standard JavaScript using tools like [Babel](https://babeljs.io). JSX is not mandatory, however, it makes development of UI a lot simpler.

## How to use:

Simply paste your JSX code in the **JSX Code** field and click **Convert to JS**. The converted code will appear in the second field. You can then click **Copy** to copy the code.
